											<h1>Pine Wood</h1>
											<img src="img/pinewood1.jpg" alt="">
											<p>Pine furniture is less expensive than many other wood pieces, especially if you buy it unfinished, which makes it a very popular choice. It can be painted, stained or covered with a clear coat of varnish. The wood’s noticeable grain and knots give each piece a unique look. Pine furniture blends well with other woods, allowing the buyer to mix and match pieces. Pine furniture adds coziness to a room, and the wood is ideal for rustic or English Country decor. Pine’s coloring keeps bookshelves, armoires, dressers and beds from appearing heavy and stuffy.
											</p>

											<p>
												Unfinished pine furniture, which can be personalized by painting or stenciling, allows great flexibility in a child’s room. The furniture can be refinished and repainted as the child’s tastes changes.
											</p>
											
											<h2>What to look for?</h2>
											<p>The quality of pine furniture can vary widely. Although pine is more pliable than most hardwoods, pieces can last for decades if it is constructed well. 
											</p>
												<p>
												Knots should be expected and can be attractive in a piece of furniture, but watch out for knots that create a hole in the furniture. Too many knots can weaken the piece. Although pine is a sturdy wood, it can easily be dented and scratched. Like all woods, pine will warp when exposed to constant humidity or moisture. Well-crafted pine will be smooth and the walls plumb. The fasteners on the drawer should create a snug fit between the front and rest of the drawer. Drawers should pull out smoothly and maintain their shape when twisted.
											</p>
											<h2>Pros</h2>
											<p> It's low-cost, and it takes paint well, so it's great for kids' furniture. (The same holds true for birch and poplar.) Pine develops a nice, rustic patina from age and use, and it resists shrinking and swelling. 
											</p>
											<h2>Cons</h2>
											<p>It's a softwood, so it's prone to scratches and dents.
