											<h1>Rubber Wood</h1>
											<img src="img/rubber_wood.jpeg" alt="">
											<p>Rubberwood is also known as plantation hardwood, parawood, or "Hevea".Although it had been used on a small scale before, its use for furniture making has become much more common in recent decades with the development of chemical treatments to protect the wood against fungal and insect attacks. There are extensive rubber plantations with mature trees, especially in southeast Asia; the earlier practice was to burn the tree at the end of its latex-producing cycle.
											</p>
											<p>
											Currently, rubber plantation trees are generally harvested for wood after they complete the latex producing cycle, when they are 25 to 30 years old. When the latex yields become extremely low, the trees are then felled, and new trees are usually planted. This makes rubberwood 'eco-friendly' in that the wood is harvested from a renewable source.
											</p>

											<h2>Durability</h2>
											<p>
												One of the biggest benefits of Rubberwood is its durability. Rubberwood has a dense grain character when compared to other types of wood. Furniture made from Rubberwood is not as prone to shrinkage or to warping as other types of material.
											</p>

											<p>
												Despite its name, it is considered a hard wood, similar to ash or maple. It handles many different types of manufacturing well, which means it is particularly useful in the creation of more complex or artistic furniture pieces. This makes it appealing to designers who are looking for something a little bit different to decorate a living space.

											<h2>Eco-Friendliness</h2>
											<p>
												Another one of the big benefits of Rubberwood is that compared to many other types of woods used in manufacturing furniture, it is relatively eco-friendly. This is because most Rubberwood is created as a part of the latex manufacturing process. Latex is derived from the sap of the tree that produces Rubberwood. It is only after a tree has stopped producing the sap used in the creation of latex and dies naturally that the tree is harvested for its wood.
